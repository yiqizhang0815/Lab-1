Lab 1 - Getting Started with GitHub

This lab is to introduce you to GitHub, the IT industry's current standard for Source Control and team collaboration.  To complete the lab:

- Research the GitHub for Education offerings
- Create a GitHub student account (this will give you 5 private repositories for free)
- Create a new repository called Lab 1
- Upload a copy of this document to your Lab 1 repository, using either the command prompt or Desktop client (you must Commit and Sync / Push)
- Once the document has been uploaded to your GitHub repo, go to the Repo in your browser
- Edit this document by making a change to the text anywhere, then save your change
- From the command prompt or desktop client, pull the change you made online down to your machine
- Make 1 more change to this file on your computer, then make another commit and push it to GitHub again
- Submit a link to your Lab 1 repository on Blackboard; there should be at least 3 commits total.  The first will show this file being pushed.  The second will show the change you made online.  The 3rd will show the change you made to this file on your computer.
